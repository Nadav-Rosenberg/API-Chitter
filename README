Reflections: 

Starting a project: 
- Gemfile
- $ bundle 
- Rakefile 
- server.rb
- $ rakup
- config.ru
- add a database 
- data_mapper_setup

Testing
- think of the MVP and test
- sketched out post request problem in server
- built first feature test for posting a peep

- troubleshooting database setup:
  - make sure modles are required correctly
  - make sure order of database setup is correct
    - setup db, require modles, finalize db, upgrade db

- posting in capybara is page.driver.post "address to post to", "content to post"
- the content to post needs to be encoded in HTTP post format "field_to_post_to=Content+to+post"

CURL
- to post from the comand line using curl use the following format
curl --data "peep=This+is+a+second+test+peep" http://localhost:9292/api/new_peep
