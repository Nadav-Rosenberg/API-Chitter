Reflections: 

Starting a project: 
- Gemfile
- $ bundle 
- Rakefile 
- server.rb
- $ rakup
- config.ru
- add a database 
- data_mapper_setup

Testing
- think of the MVP and test
- sketched out post request problem in server
- built first feature test for posting a peep

- troubleshooting database setup:
  - make sure modles are required correctly
  - make sure order of database setup is correct
    - setup db, require modles, finalize db, upgrade db

- posting in capybara is page.driver.post "address to post to", "content to post"
- the content to post needs to be encoded in HTTP post format "field_to_post_to=Content+to+post"

CURL
- to post from the comand line using curl use the following format
curl --data "peep=This+is+a+second+test+peep" http://localhost:9292/api/new_peep


Post Request
- every post request triggers a response from the server, which can be read by using the method .body


--Updated plan
Day 2
  -Finishing backend API, including sessions
  - Today we want an MVP of the front end

Day3 
  -Finishing the front end 
  - potentially start styling
Day 4
  additional features
  - reply to a peep
  - mobile/text interface

Sessions: 

- Sinatra creates an sutomatic session key-vlaue hash (posssibly as a class variable), whenever it recieves an HTTP request.

- In order to text using curl one must require curl to store cookies using -c (to edit cookies) and -b (to use cookies) 

Curl commands: 

Sign Up: 
curl --data "email=nadav@nadav.com&name=Nadav&user_name=Nad&password=123&password_confirmation=123" http://localhost:9292/api/sign_up

Sign In:
curl -c cookies.txt --data "email=nadav@nadav.com&password=123" http://localhost:9292/api/sign_in

New Peep: 
curl -b cookies.txt --data "peep=Test+Peep" http://localhost:9292/api/new_peep

All Peeps:
curl http://localhost:9292/api/all_peeps
